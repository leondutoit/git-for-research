### git_for_Research

Solve collaboration problems and keep track of changes with version control.

### Setup

No matter which option you choose, please make sure that by the time the course starts you can open a terminal application on your machine and successfully run `git --help`.

If you need a refresher or an introduction to using the command line then I suggest reading through [learn enough command line to be dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial).

#### Option 1: use a virtual machine

* [download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [download](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/104325750/pydatsci_vm.zip) the course VM, unzip it
* start VirtualBox
* add the vm: `Machines` -> `Add` -> `path-to-folder`
* start the vm
* the username is `leon` and the password is `wp`
* start the terminal: press `alt + ctrl + t`

#### Option 2: install git yourself

* [download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* make sure you can run git from the command line

#### Option 3: use a remote machine

As long as git is available there :)
